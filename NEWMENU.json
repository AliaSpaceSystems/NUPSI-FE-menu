It can penetrate smog, fog, and thin clouds, and exhibits specific reflection properties over different materials, allowing for day and night imaging provided there is sufficient ambient light. These properties make SWIR invaluable for several applications: assessing moisture in plants and soil; differentiating water bodies from other surfaces; distinguishing between water and ice clouds, as well as snow and ice from other surfaces, all of which appear white in visible light; evaluating vegetation health and types; identifying various soil types and built-up areas; mapping different rock types due to their distinct SWIR reflectance; and assessing fire damage, as newly burned land strongly reflects SWIR. In the default composite imagery, vegetation appears in shades of green, soils and built-up areas in various shades of brown, and water appears black. The bands used for this visualisation are the B12-SWIR, B8A-Short NIR  and B04-Red with a composite resolution of 20 m.",

The VH polarization has higher values for surfaces characterized by volume scattering, e.g., branches, dry coil bodies, or canopies (lighter color in the visualization) and lower for surfaces with little to no scattering (darker color in the visualization). Compared to the linear gamma0 visualization, the decibel gamma0 visualization includes a logarithmic scaling of the data.",

Water bodies appear dark, and urban areas appear in shades of grey or tan. This makes the False Color composite particularly useful for assessing plant health, monitoring water bodies, distinguishing between different types of land cover, and identifying features in urban landscapes. The enhanced contrast and unique color assignments make it easier to analyze various environmental and man-made features, providing clear insights not as evident in true color imagery.

Values close to zero, typically ranging from -0.1 to 0.1, represent barren areas such as rock, sand, or snow, and are depicted in light to dark shades of grey. Low positive values, from 0.2 to 0.4, indicate shrub and grassland areas, with colors ranging from pale yellow to light green. High values, approaching 1, correspond to dense temperate and tropical rainforests, represented by varying shades of green, from lighter greens (0.5) to dark green (1).

In snowy or icy areas, colors range from light green-yellow to bright green, brown, and black. To avoid confusion between cryogenic and non-cryogenic features, general location information is helpful for image interpretation. Compared to S1 SAR Urban, which focuses on identifying urban areas and individual buildings, S1 Enhanced Color Visualization offers a broader view, distinguishing between water, land, and terrain types. While S1 SAR Urban excels in tracking urban expansion and analyzing buildings, S1 Enhanced Color Visualization is more suited for environmental and landscape studies. On the other hand it differs from the RGB Ratio that uses the VV, VH, and VH/VV ratio to create a more contrasted image that highlights urban areas, water, and vegetation with distinct colors.",

It can penetrate smog, fog, and thin clouds, and exhibits specific reflection properties over different materials, allowing for day and night imaging provided there is sufficient ambient light. These properties make SWIR invaluable for several applications: assessing moisture in plants and soil; differentiating water bodies from other surfaces; distinguishing between water and ice clouds, as well as snow and ice from other surfaces, all of which appear white in visible light; evaluating vegetation health and types; identifying various soil types and built-up areas; mapping different rock types due to their distinct SWIR reflectance; and assessing fire damage, as newly burned land strongly reflects SWIR. In the default composite imagery, vegetation appears in shades of green, soils and built-up areas in various shades of brown, and water appears black. The bands used for this visualisation are the B12-SWIR, B8A-Short NIR  and B04-Red with a composite resolution of 20 m.",
